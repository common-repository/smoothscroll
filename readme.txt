Adds smoothscrolling to your website for better user experience.

== Description ==

A minimal but flexible plugin build to improve user experience.

All features below are optional.

* Add smoothscrolling to your website
* Add smoothscrolling to your admin panel
* Change smoothscrolling settings such as frame rate, animation time, etc.
* Keyboard support
* Touchpad support
* Testing: this will enable smoothscrolling for admins only, allowing you to play around with the custom options

This plugin also automatically checks if the visitors' browser has already added any smoothscrolling- when that is the case, this plugin will automatically disable its functionality.
